Deep Learning with Python Datacamp course

## Queries
Using README as a Backlog for questions about Networks/Deep Learning - hopefully these are answered as we go along:

1. It is simple to create a model with a network when you have the inputs and weights, but how do you determine the weights to use? I would guess this is the most complex part of this type of analysis

2. How do we determine which activation function is best to use? Is it data dependent? Or is it just a paramater we tweak like any other to get a more accurate model?

3. Do we need to normalize/scale the input data as with standard statistical models? From the examples used it would appear not, but would be useful to know why.
